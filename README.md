### Destiny 2 Builder

This is a tool you can use to basically theorycraft and spreadsheet a build in Destiny 2. The UI mimics the inventory screen that we have in game and allows you to plan out what weapons and armor you want in a particular build along with the mods that go into them. You can choose your subclass, subclass skills, change your stats, and take a few notes on certain aspects of the build.
