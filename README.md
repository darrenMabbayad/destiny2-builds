### Destiny 2 Builder

The idea behind this app is to mimic the build crafting capabilities of https://app.destinyitemmanager.com (DIM). However, DIM only uses items in your current inventory/vault space to create builds. This app's goal is to plan out builds with specific stats/gear/mods that users can come back to and see what they need to acquire in game until they complete the build.

**Technologies Used**

- React
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Node.js
